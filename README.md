# Failure Mode Example Check

## Overview
This project analyzes wafer failure patterns using the WM-811K (LSWMD) dataset.

The goal is to explore statistical and machine learning approaches for failure mode classification.

## Dataset

This project uses the WM-811K wafer map dataset.

The dataset file `LSWMD.pkl` is not included in this repository due to size and distribution restrictions.
